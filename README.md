# MSDS434Project
Final Project with Table of contents and videos

## Step 1: Identify the Problem
### What area of interest do you have for the project?
The world's population is more than three times larger than it was in the mid-twentieth century. The global human population reached 8.0 billion in mid-November 2022 from an estimated 2.5 billion people in 1950. However, some countries' net population is decreasing year by year. The population changed based on fertility rate and death rate.
I am interested in how the fertility rate differs between countries.

### What types of questions are you interested in answering?
What are the important factors to impact a country’s fertility rate?
Examples: education level, GDP, living cost, healthcare cost, child care benefit, religion, race.
What is the most important factor to impact a country’s fertility rate?
How/What can we do to help a country to either increase or decrease the fertility rate?
If we have those contributing factors for the fertility rate, are we able to predict the fertility rate for a country for the next few years?


## Step 2: Identify the Data Set

### Identify a potential data set for your final project and any added detail based on your interests.
UN website has GDP, fertility rate, education level and cost of living index for different countries.  These can be the potential data fit my final project.  However, they are multiple data set and I will need to combine them together.  There are also lots of missing data cells; therefore, I also need to clean it before I can use it.

### Address the ways that GitHub can be leveraged in order to support the development of your application throughout the entire software development lifecycle.
Application will be built progressively, and it can be done in 1 day with all the feature in it.  Github can help to keep track the change, store and organize the application wisely.  It help to integrate all small piece of components into a large fully functional application.  It is open for everyone able to look the codes to see how the application was built.   It also benefit for people who work as a team to keep track the change.  Notification can be sent to remind other people to aware the progress.  It is easy to connect to AWS or GCP those online server to keep the application run over the night with minimum amount of maintenance.   

## Step 3: Construct a Functional Specification
