Final Project with Table of contents and videos

## Week 1: Identify the Problem
### What area of interest do you have for the project?
The world's population is more than three times larger than it was in the mid-twentieth century. The global human population reached 8.0 billion in mid-November 2022 from an estimated 2.5 billion people in 1950. However, some countries' net population is decreasing year by year. The population changed based on fertility rate and death rate.
I am interested in how the fertility rate differs between countries.

### What types of questions are you interested in answering?
What are the important factors to impact a country’s fertility rate?
Examples: education level, GDP, living cost, healthcare cost, child care benefit, religion, race.
What is the most important factor to impact a country’s fertility rate?
How/What can we do to help a country to either increase or decrease the fertility rate?
If we have those contributing factors for the fertility rate, are we able to predict the fertility rate for a country for the next few years?
